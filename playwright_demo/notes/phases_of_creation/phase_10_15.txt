This txt file discusses the AI integration. Here we are essentially starting to build out the AI. 

well i essentially built out all the AI... will have to come back and fix steps 10-15...

now these are the next steps. 

After Orchestrator Works
    1. Test with Simple Goals (Next immediate step)

        "Go to Google and search for Python"
        "Navigate to Amazon"
        Verify the full loop: snapshot → AI → action → repeat

    2. Refine the AI Prompting

        Improve prompt_builder.py to give Claude better context
        Add examples of good actions
        Handle edge cases (page not loaded, element not found)

    3. Add Error Recovery

        What if Claude suggests a bad selector?
        What if navigation fails?
        Retry logic, fallback strategies

    4. Test Complex Goals

        "Find the cheapest laptop under $500 on Amazon"
        Multi-step workflows
        See where it breaks, fix it

    5. Polish & Documentation

        Clean up debug prints
        Add proper logging
        Write README explaining the architecture
        Record a demo video

    6. Submit to Employer 🎯

        Show working demo
        Explain architecture decisions
        Highlight MCP integration
        Discuss challenges you solved (like the stdio vs HTTP issue!)
